/// A wrapper around a blk-mq `struct request`. This represents an IO request.
///
/// # Implementation details
///
/// There are four states for a request that the Rust bindings care about:
///
/// A) Request is owned by block layer (refcount 0)
/// B) Request is owned by driver but with zero `ARef`s in existence
///    (refcount 1)
/// C) Request is owned by driver with exactly one `ARef` in existence
///    (refcount 2)
/// D) Request is owned by driver with more than one `ARef` in existence
///    (refcount > 2)
///
///
/// We need to track A and B to ensure we fail tag to request conversions for
/// requests that are not owned by the driver.
///
/// We need to track C and D to ensure that it is safe to end the request and hand
/// back ownership to the block layer.
///
/// The states are tracked through the private `refcount` field of
/// `RequestDataWrapper`. This structure lives in the private data area of the C
/// `struct request`.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// * `self.0` is a valid `struct request` created by the C portion of the kernel.
/// * The private data area associated with this request must be an initialized
///   and valid `RequestDataWrapper<T>`.
/// * `self` is reference counted by atomic modification of
///   self.wrapper_ref().refcount().
